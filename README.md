This simple python script copies all files from a given path to another location in given intervals (10 minutes by default)\n
It also deletes the eldest backup when their amount reaches a given number (5 backups by default) \n
It can be used for dynamically changing files that you would like to safekeep\n
I personally used it to save my Elden Ring saves from corrupting
